#ACS
Automatic Cloud Synchronization

Written in C#, this program's purpose is to keep any folder or file up-to-date on your machine. More precisely,
it will check whether or not choosen files/folders that are hosted online are new and if so, replace them with the local's ones every x times.
I'll start with git support and if possible later include support for dropbox, google drive, etc...
Feel free to contribute to this project.


Note : they are chances that I will later rewrite it in C++ with QT.
